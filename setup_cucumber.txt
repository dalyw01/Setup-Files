I downloaded "devkit" into the same directory where RUBY is installed (usually C:\ drive) alongside 
	bins
	doc
	include
	etc

Inside "devkit" I had files like 
	dk.rb
	devkitvars.bat
	msys.bat

Go here if you're getting an SSL errror from above link - http://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-update/#installing-using-update-packages
