Go here for most of the info you'll need! - https://www.spritecloud.com/2015/04/complete-setup-guide-for-ruby-cucumber-and-watir-on-windows/

Do NOT install - "watir-webdriver" (It's been deprecated)

I downloaded "devkit" into the same directory where RUBY is installed (usually C:\ drive) alongside 
	bins
	doc
	include
	etc

Inside "devkit" I had files like 
	dk.rb
	devkitvars.bat
	msys.bat


Download  "rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem" and place inside "devkit" directory
