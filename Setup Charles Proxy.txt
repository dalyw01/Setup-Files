TESTING WITH CHARLES
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ORDER IS IMPORTANT

+++++++++++++++++++
SETUP PC
+++++++++++++++++++

- Green (or YELLOW) cable IN
- Network share ON (This is under SHARING, turn it on/off seems to do the trick if it's being a pain)
- Wi-fi OFF
- Location OFF
- Start running CHARLES

+++++++++++++++++++
SETUP Android Phone
+++++++++++++++++++

- Go to SETTINGS
- Find network with name of PC Charles is running on (MY laptop appears as MC-S104581)
- Tap + Hold that network name
- Tap Modify Network
- Tap Advanced Options
- Tap Proxy Manual

- Proxy hostname = To get IP of PC go to         [Apple Logo] -> [System Preferences] -> Network
- Proxy Port     = To get PORT of your PC go to  [Charles]    -> Proxy                -> Proxy Settings

- CONNECT to the PC you’ve configured

NOTE : You can connect to a PC WITHOUT setting hostname + port
       However if you don't then the info will not be collected in Charles

+++++++++++++++++++
SETUP Iphone
+++++++++++++++++++

- Go to SETTINGS
- Under HTTP Proxy
- Server = IP of PC (e.g 192.168.3.121 USUALLY)
- Port   = 8888
- Authentication OFF

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Getting A Cookie + Checking
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Connect to a different network from your PC ( MediaPlayout / pullmyfingers1 )
Once you do that you should be given a cookie
Run javascript:alert and see output for cookie (S1)
Connected to my machine MC-S104581
Cleared stats inspector
Cleared BBC Media App info on my phone
Went to the following URL with my phone -> is.gd/ruplify
Typical output if cookies WERE set = ns_alias | 160.119.56DEB2C60025EF01F2CFDF2985

    Go to STATS INSPECTOR
    Click on an SMP
    Go BACK to STATS INSPECTOR
    There should be info generated ECHO/DAX/Istats etc.
    Begin Testing!

    Basically if you see the grey wi-fi icon and an upwards arrow you’re good!
